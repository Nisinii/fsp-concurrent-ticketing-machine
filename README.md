# FSP Concurrent Ticketing System in Java

This project is a thread-safe ticketing system simulator built with Java. It models a real-world scenario where multiple actors (technicians and users) attempt to access a shared resource (a ticketing machine) concurrently.

The system's logic was first modelled using **FSP (Finite State Processes)** to define and analyze the concurrent behaviors, ensuring a correct-by-design approach before implementation. The final application uses Java's concurrency utilities to manage shared resources and prevent race conditions, with a functional GUI built using Java Swing.

## ‚ú® Core Concepts & Features

This simulation models three main concurrent actors:

* **Paper Technician:** A thread that can refill the machine's paper supply.
* **Toner Technician:** A thread that can refill the machine's toner supply.
* **User (Student):** A thread that attempts to print a ticket, which requires both paper and toner.

The primary challenge is to ensure that these operations can happen concurrently without causing inconsistencies (e.g., printing with no paper, refilling while printing).

### Concurrency Management

To ensure thread safety and system consistency, the following Java concurrency mechanisms were implemented:

* **Synchronization:** Used to protect critical sections of code where shared resources (like toner and paper levels) are modified.
* **ReentrantLocks:** Implemented to provide more flexible and fine-grained locking control than standard synchronization, helping to prevent deadlocks.
* **Semaphores:** Used to manage access to the limited resources (paper and toner), ensuring a user cannot print unless all required resources are available.

### Design

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The system is built using strong OOP principles, encapsulating the printer's state and behavior.
* **Design Patterns:** Utilized appropriate design patterns to structure the code for maintainability and scalability.
* **GUI:** The graphical user interface was built using **Java Swing** to provide a visual representation of the machine's state and the actions of each thread.
